		You experience a lot of different stress in high school, from offline groupmates to super difficult questions in tests, it's either u cope with it and try to survive or you don't know what to do, and so your emotions will get the best of you, become stressed, possibly even lash out on your groupmates or your friends. (though it's good to remind them that they have to do something, it's still bad behaviour to get mad at them. 
		Then again most people, including me think that it's the best way to get the idea across their heads) 
		<br>
		<div class="yes">
		<img src="./images/rcagain.png" height="500px" width="500px" id="melon">
		<br>
		<button class="stylebtn" onclick="document.getElementById('melon').src='./images/rc.png'">Turn on the stress</button>
		<button class="stylebtn" onclick="document.getElementById('melon').src='./images/rcagain.png'">Turn off the stress</button>
			</div>
		<br><br>
		If only you can just press a button and all your worries and stress are gone, and you can finish your task in peace.
		<br><br>
		<br<br>
		As of right now, I'm stressed in what type of stress experience I can tell that can be relatable. Thoughts like 'Am I doing this right? Am I doing something wrong here' or 'am I being pabuhat with my groupmates right now because the only thing im good at is trying to make things look pretty but i can't do technical stuff' occupy my head for a long time to the point that im even scared to start this experience page that was i was assigned to do. 
	<br><br>
	It's 11:36pm. 
	<br><br>
Almost all projects that I do, I do them at night. And most of them are group or individual projects. I tried my best to do bits of them days before the deadline to prevent doing them at midnight, but here we are. Getting myself stressed. 
<br><br>

<br>
But what stresses me the most is that in group projects, I'm one of the few people doing something. Like, most of the groupmates aren't doing anything, or aren't taking their job seriously.
<br><br>
I sort of get it, if I'm going to be honest. There's different situations that can happen, like say you're trying to confirm something so that you can start your task given, but your groupmates are offline so what can you do? Then, you suddenly became in charge and reminded everyone that they have to finish a deadline. 
<br>

<br><br>
The worst part is that they go offline or quiet for a long time and they don't send any updates, or even maybe state valid reasons why they can't do it. (such as getting sick or having an important family matter)
<br<br> 
<br><br>
But you don't want to seem pushy or disrespectful. In the end, you seem conflicted and don't know what to do. At least, that's how I feel. That my friends, is where the stress kicks in.
To keep things short, I just have no choice but to try to negotiate and work with my groupmates, because in the end, we have to go through all this. Again, and again.

		<p class="about">Racquel Catolico is an amateur artist studying in Philippine Science High School. She loves drawing and watching youtube, and currently she's into pokemon and character design. I don't know what else to say about myself really besides those. My favorite subject so far this school year would be CS because of the unlimited things you can create in websites but that's about it.
