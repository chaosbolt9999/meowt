		<h1> Stress Experiences </h1>
		<p class="blogsubtitle"> by Dylan Dalida </p>
		You’re at that point again. Two projects and a long test due tomorrow, and you’re barely halfway done in preparing for any of them. Sometimes, you feel like you just want it all to stop. You want to rest. You want to feel free from everything that’s pulling you down right now.
		<br><br>
		Don’t worry. I feel that too.
		<br><br>
		As a guy with loads of extracurriculars going on, there are things I have to balance when it comes to requirements. For example, when I go on contests that require me to be out for a few days, I have to basically beg my teachers for an extension. There’s a drafting plate due on Friday. “Ma’am, pwede po bang sa Monday na lang?” There’s a quiz about the lesson which I haven’t read. “Ma’am, pwede po bang icancel na lang?” Bargaining just to make your head a little less stressed. And yeah, it’s hard.
		<br><br>
		Most of the time, the teacher will move the deadline, because he or she is pretty lenient in moving deadlines. But sometimes that won’t happen. So I have to bring my laptop just so that I could finish a labrep. And it’s super stressful to see those reqs piling up on you when you HAVE to join the cultural exchange or something in an hour. And it sucks. It sucks a lot.
		<br><br>
		But... there's always a silver lining.
		<br><br>
		Even though the requirements keep piling up, I always think of the end goal. How everything will be done by the end of the week. How I'd feel carefree after obliterating the last of the requirement list. How I'd be calmer if I finished everything quicker.
  		<br><br>
  		Then I'd take a break.
  		<br><br>
  		Then I'd keep going.
 		<br><br>
  		I'd speed through everything until the very end, when I would finally be free.
  		<br><br>
  		Right now I'm right in the middle of everything. Trying to finish six requirements in six days. But I know that this, too, shall pass.
