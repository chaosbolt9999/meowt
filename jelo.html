		<h1> Stress Experience </h1>
		<p> By Anjelo Fan </p>
	In school there are a lot of things that stress us out. Homeworks, tests, projects and usually all of them stacked together and due on the same day. I know it can be stressful and we have all been there. But let me tell you something odd about me, I tend to put myself in scenarios where I feel a lot of stress. Now, it kind of seems weird or unusual that you would do something like that. The only reason I have for it is because I try my best to simulate what a stressful scenario would be like, so when an untimely even comes I wouldn't get stressed as much as I normally would. This behavior at some point changed how the way I think so most of the time I would just stay calm and not worry about things.
	<br>
	<br>
	To be honest, I don't feel stressed all that often. I like procrastinating and usually end up having to do my reqs in the morning before class starts.I always manage to finish everything without much trouble. I think what helped a lot was that I usually plan ahead on how to do the tasks. Most of the time I find that I just look for the easiest way to finish the task. But sometimes things don't go according to plan. 
        <br>
	<br>
        In grade 8 I had a project in socsci which was about showcasing an assigned philosophy in a comic. I was assigned the task to be the editor. I procrastinated so much until two days before the deadline. A lot of problems arose when I realized that I understood nothing in the script/storyboard. I tried my best to make progress and when I was halfway there, I realized that it was already morning. The night before the deadline, my old laptop froze because of how much images I had loaded and I lost some of my progress. At this point I was getting stressed. Everything I was doing was very slow because my laptop constantly froze. In the end, we managed to pass a somewhat decent project. We had a sigh of relief when our teacher gave us a chance to pass again at a later deadline.
        <br>
	<br>
        I learned a lot from this experience. One of the most important things I learned though, was to calm down and think since I feel that it is definitely easier to do your tasks when you are not stressed.
