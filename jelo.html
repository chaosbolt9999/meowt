	In school there are a lot of things that stress us out. Homeworks, tests, projects and usually all of them stacked together and due on the same day. I know it can be stressful and we have all been there. But let me tell you something odd about me, I tend to put myself in scenarios where I feel a lot of stress. Now, it kind of seems weird or unusual that you would do something like that. The only reason I have for it is because I try my best to simulate what a stressful scenario would be like, so when an untimely even comes I wouldn't get stressed as much as I normally would. This behavior at some point changed how the way I think so most of the time I would just stay calm and not worry about things. Though, there is one time I really felt like I was very stressed.
